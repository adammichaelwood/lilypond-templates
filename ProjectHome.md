Some templates that I put together to make using the templates from the documentation easy. It hooks into the inbuilt Emacs template system skeleton-mode. This means that they are interactive templates.

Where possible I've tried to use the LilyPond info files to access more useful information within the templates so they can be useful to beginning users of lilypond. I have tried it on linux and windows.

LilyPond is a moving target and I did these for 11.20 or so. The documentation has improved greatly since I put these together last year. But I thought I'd put them up here for interested people. Most of the templates should work fine as they are. Some time soon I intend to update the templates to the more recent documentation examples.
